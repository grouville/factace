# factrace
Factorize an integer as fast as possible using the Pollard's Rho algorithm

First rush : 48 hours to understand a concept and find the best solution.

It was an intro to RSA code cracking by factorizing any big number as fast as possible. In order to do that, I implemented the Pollard's Rho algorithm.

To use this program, first <b>make</b>, then copy this string to your shell :<b>./factmouli factrace resources/test00.ftr</b> and replace the number to one of the tests.

The project was a race, the aim was to go as far as possible in the list.
